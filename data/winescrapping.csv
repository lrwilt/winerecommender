Beautiful acidity balances this very extroverted, aromatic white Rhone. The nose is an inviting explosion of stone fruit and wet stone and that power carries through the palate beautifully. This vintage is the best Viognier we’ve ever made! Enjoy it with quiche, aged cheeses, or on a sunny afternoon.||38|2020-10-01

For those moments when a touch of balanced sweetness is just right, our Vin de Paille is the perfect choice. Making this wine was unlike any we've ever attempted. Channeling some very old world winemaking tactics, we harvested these Viognier grapes at the same time as those that go into our dry 12 O'Clock High Viognier. Harvesting a the grapes for a dessert wine that early in the season means beautiful, natural acidity. We firmly believe that acid is the key to a dessert wine that has none of that cloying, over-the-top sugar you find in some dessert wines. To achieve the desired level of sweetness, we laid down each cluster by hand on a bed of straw ('Vin de Paille' translates to 'wine of straw'). The straw naturally dehydrated the berries, which concentrates that naturally-occurring sugar. The result? Well, Bob nailed it. It's like the greatest nectar you've ever enjoyed an ounce of!"||50|2020-10-01

Downslope is a total crowd pleaser: rich Alta Colina fruit that’s also approachable enough to enjoy right now. This is a no-brainer, screwcap red blend to stay stocked up on year round.Alta Colina Vineyard is steep! At its peak, we hit almost 1800 feet of altitude and our vines grow on the unwelcoming, stressful, shale hillsides of our Adelaida District property. Over years of farming we found that the portions of our Vineyard furthest down the hills (down the slopes!), consistently grow more fruit because they’re less stressed than the rest of the Vineyard. Top soil has eroded downhill, which provides those vines nutrients and slightly more access to water. We’re able to get closer to two bottles of wine per vine at the bottoms of the hills versus just one bottle of wine per vine everywhere else on the property.||34|2020-10-01

Aged for six months in the Amphora prior to bottling. There is just a kiss of sweetness in this Chenin. As with any Chenin worth its salt, the nose is subtle with a slight aroma of pine nut, wet stone and blanched almond. It’s fresh and pure. Of course that kiss of sweetness is evident on the palate. This wine for me is more about texture and finesse than anything overtly fruit driven. Mineral driven with gentle neb and verbena notes. Silky smooth all the way home!! Can you sense the amphora? Bring me a Thai coconut based curry and I will be happy.||35|2020-10-01

A gentleman's club of days pat, it is leatherand whispy cigar smoke. Fruit is bright and present, red currant cloaked in dark chocolate. The structureis so complete and intertwined it is elegant.

Glycerol is responsible for the viscous mouth feel and can be visually seen as “legs” on the side of your wine glass when you swirl. What glycerol does to your glass it does to your mouth, coats it with rich, lingering flavors. The Grenache Blanc gives this wine bright acidity and distinct pear, citrus, and herbal flavors. The higher alcohol content that Grenache Blanc has often leaves a spice-like finish. Delicious!||28|2020-10-01

Once again, we dedicate our very popular Vin Rosé to our, unfortunately many, club members, friends, and family who have been touched by cancer. We personally know that it is hope, and loved ones, who get us through these difficult times, thus the name Liquid Hope. Whether it is you personally, or someone close to you, this devastating diagnosis touches the lives of so many.

As it states on the back of the label, our Rosé was crafted to be enjoyed and shared now, not in 5 years, as we know that our friends battling illness and their families are living in the hopes and possibilities of today, not tomorrow. $1 of every bottle has been donated to help those who are currently faced with cancer. We are hopeful that every little bit helps.

Please raise a glass in celebration of the gift of another day for the many of you who have put this battle behind, and for the hopes and possibilities that lay ahead for those who are currently facing difficult times. Also, please say a toast for those who have passed, and are still vibrant in our hearts, including my beloved mom, Tina.

A puncheon is a large barrel (a traditional barrel is 60 gallons) which, due to the surface to volume ratio, gives the wine soft notes of sweet oak.

https://www.villicanawinery.com/|http://www.americanwineryguide.com/regions/adelaida-district-ava-wineries/|Adelaida District|Paso Robles|CA|Estate Merlot|Red|Varietal|Merlot:1|2017|We have slightly less than an acre of this varietal planted in just the perfect spot. So perfect, that we are unable to expand on the planting. It is planted at the lowest section of our vineyard where the soil is deepest because it benefits from the erosion from the rest of our hillside vineyard. We employ a deficit irrigation philosophy (using sparse irrigation during the growing season) which keeps the berries in the clusters very small. The lack of excess water in the grape enables us to craft a wine that is robust in flavor and color. Also, by not fully irrigating the vineyard, the roots of the Merlot vines dig deep looking for water giving the vines more character and flavor layers for Alex to do his magic. The movie Sideways cast a dark cloud over the Merlot varietal however, if planted in the right place and farmed properly we would put this varietal up against any other!||45|2020-10-01

This rich wine has a medium-high tannin structure combined with rich plum and red fruit flavors. It is perfect for cold nights as it pairs beautifully with heartier dishes like stews, shepherd's pie, lasagna, and creamy bisques. It is one of the more onerous varities to get fully ripe as it needs a hot, dry climate. Our hilltop vineyard facilitates warmer fall weather which allows us to grow this variety to its full potential which is why we like to showcase it as a 100% varietal wine.

Our Zinfandel vineyard is terraced into a south facing hillside and is sparsely irrigated. We use the irrigation to keep the grapes hydrated before harvest allowing the grapes to stay on the vine longer, thus maximizing ripeness which imparts flavors of plum and rich red fruit.

Paso Robles. Extremely low levels of rainfall and very mild winter
temperatures produced a low-yielding early-ripening crop. Small
berries produced concentrated tannins, acids, flavors and color. A
challenging season for the vines, yet an excellent one for wine
quality.
Production: Both of these varieties are late ripening, which
allowed them to hang in the vineyard and be harvested on the
same day. In that way, they were fermented together in 1-ton open
top tanks. The destemmed whole berries were pumped over for the
initial 3 days of ferment until the yeast population had maximized.
At this point, a daily routine of 3 punch downs was maintained
until the free run juice was dry. The berries were then pressed and
all wine combined into once-used French puncheons after 12 hours
of settling. The wine was aged an additional 18 months without
racking.
Ageing: The inherent massive tannins, vibrant acidity and deep
dark fruit character of these wines beg for ageing. This bottle
should soften and develop complexity beautifully for 10 – 14 years.
Comments: This wine, made in Paso Robles in 2014, happens to
be an exact match for a dinner a dear friend served us in Northern
California over 5 years ago: braised brisket with pomegranate
juice, chestnuts and turnips; pumpkin and saffron jasmine rice
pilaf; tabbouleh with apples, walnuts and pomegranates; a simple
green salad. Create your own version of this meal and open a
bottle of our 2014 Paso Robles Red. Let your experiences of the two
meals--real and imaginary--mingle as you feast."|0.144|36|2020-10-05

for the Paso Robles area. Rainfall for the year was about 30% of
usual, and the hard times were compounded by a spring frost that
thinned out an already small crop. By the time harvest came
around, yields were down by about half across area vineyards,
but the quality of the grapes was fantastic. This Grenache Blanc is
a testament to white wines made in vintages like this, deeply
golden in color and full of rich fruit.
Production: The Grenache Blanc was hand-harvested and
allowed to soak on skins for 12 hours before pressing. The freshly
pressed juice was intentionally oxidized to remove browning
agents and bring roundness to the massive acid present. It was
then cold settled for 24 hours and racked to once-used French oak
puncheons for fermentation. After completion of primary fermentation, all wine was racked to a single puncheon and left to age on
lees for 9 months.
Ageing: The heavy fruit and great acidity in this wine will allow
this to be a fairly strong ager for a white wine. It should drink
beautifully well into 2019/2020.
Comments: Put a bottle of our 2015 Paso Robles White in the
fridge to chill some hot summer day, then wait for the sun to drop
below the horizon. The slanted golden light is mirrored by the wine
in your glass. The plants straighten up around you as they are
relieved of the heat of the day by the evening breeze. A plate of
sliced peaches, goat’s milk cheese, pistachios, dried cherries and
crackers might be in order. That or a really good green curry."|0.137|28|2020-10-05

It is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon and consists of our winemaker, Scott Shirley's, favorite barrels from the best barrel lots. This beautiful wine is the purest expression of Cabernet Sauvignon achieved from this vintage.
Each bottle is decorated in platinum, a prized precious metal which suitably illustrates the scarcity of this limited production. Only the Cabernet Sauvignon with the darkest fruit character and ample tannin structure was shortlisted for consideration in the blend.
Twenty-four months of bottle aging prior to release helps ensure that all components have had ample time to marry and integrate, but additional time in the bottle will surely be rewarded Appearance: Bright, with a dense ruby/purple core showing black secondary hue, becoming lighter toward the rim with slow-forming deeply stained tears on the glass.

Aroma: Very aromatic with rich, ripe black fruit of cherry and blackcurrant jam with vanilla, toasted oak, red and black licorice, sweet tobacco, leather, cedar and camphor.

Palate: Full bodied and mouth-filling with ripe black fruit, oak and barrel spice on entry and a mid-palate showing sustained ripe fruit matched with savory dried autumn leaf elements. Mouth-filling, chewy tannins build through a very long, balanced and fresh finish layered with lingering fruit, licorice, cedar, camphor and oak notes. With a solid dark fruit core balanced by savory and textural elements and drinking nicely on release, the 2016 PLATINUM Reserve is a serious Cabernet that does not really need to be laid down to enjoy. But if you are inclined to do so, it will build further in balance and complexity in a few years. This wine will pair beautifully with a perfectly grilled prime, aged, or Wagyu steak with simple seasonings."|0.162|170|2020-10-08

A blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon supported by Cabernet Franc and Merlot, the 2017 ISOSCELES shows why Paso Robles is such a great place to grow these varieties. Appearance: Dark ruby/purple/black core, lighter ruby/purple toward the rim with moderate plus viscosity and slow forming, moderately stained tears.

Aroma: Highly aromatic and complex with lush, ripe black cherry, black currant and boysenberry with vanilla, cinnamon spice, sweet tobacco and savory notes of leather, camphor and cedar.

Palate: Full bodied and luxuriant with ripe black fruit, mostly cherry and black currant with mixed ripe berries and barrel spice on entry. The mid-palate features continued fruit with subtle savory elements of autumn leaf, leather, and cedar with rounded, plush tannins that extend into a long finish featuring black cherry and camphor notes. The 2017 ISOSCELES is a full, complex and rich wine that is drinking nicely on release and will offer added complexity in a few years.  Try it with a slowly braised beef or lamb stew, or with a taste of high quality dark chocolate.
